        <p class = "history-text">In 1937, Peter “Brains” Tumulty began operating a tavern at the corner of George and Washington Streets in downtown New Brunswick.
          (Don’t look for Washington Street — it no longer exists)  “University Pub” as the tavern was known, was a watering hole for a
          colorful blend of New Brunswick townspeople, politicians, students and businessmen.  Rumor has it that if you had an inclination to place a
          wager on a horse, there were certain “customers” happy to help fulfill that inclination.</p>

  <p class = "history-text">In 1962, Peter’s son Frank, a schoolteacher, and his wife, Helen, decided to buy the tavern and turn it into a restaurant.
    The Pub’s success grew until April 1, 1970, (yes, April Fool’s Day) when a fire destroyed the kitchen.
    Frank decided to tear down the old building, and in September of 1970, “Tumulty’s Pub” opened in “The New Building.”</p>

  <p class = "history-text">Tumulty’s thrived during the “70’s.  It was the “First Date” restaurant for many Rutgers students, a meeting place for businesspeople,
    and with model electric trains roaming the dining room, a great place for parents to bring their children.</p>

  <p class = "history-text">In the late 1970’s, the revitalization of downtown New Brunswick began.  With the support of the City and Johnson & Johnson,
      Tumulty’s moved to its present location in July, 1982.  Frank and Helen retired in 1985.  Their son Peter and son-in-law Bob Brandes have managed the business since.
